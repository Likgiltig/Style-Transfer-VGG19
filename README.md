### **StyleTransfer with VGG19**

**A Python project demonstrating style transfer using the VGG19 model.**

**Prerequisites:**
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* Pillow (PIL)
* NumPy

**Installation:**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Likgiltig/Style-Transfer-VGG19.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow pillow numpy
   ```
**Usage:**
1. Move the content image and the style image to the script location.
2. Change the content_path and style_path variables to fit the image filenames.
3. Run script

**Optional:**
* Change the epoch_ammount variable to change the amount of times it will do the Style Transfer.
* Change the image_size variable to set the size you want on the output images (This will affect performance).

**Recommendation:**
Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects. This ensures a cleaner and more predictable development environment.
